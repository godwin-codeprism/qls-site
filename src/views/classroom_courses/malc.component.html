            <h2>Managing across the Lifecycle (MALC)</h2>
            <p>The intent of the Managing across the Lifecycle (MALC) qualification is to give candidates the skills to support an organizationâ€™s service delivery by bridging the service lifecycle stages. The qualification demonstrates that candidates have learned the value of one combined service management practice as opposed to separate subject areas. ITIL processes and practices, as learnt from the lifecycle and capability streams of the intermediate certificates, are put into a context of delivering this value.</p>
            <p>The learning outcomes are intended to bring a candidate from ITIL content knowledge to ITIL content application and integration knowledge, and provide skills that can be used in the workplace in a tangible way. Testing and validation of knowledge take place at Bloom's taxonomy level 4 (analyzing) and level 5 (evaluating), reflecting the focus on integration when compared with the ITIL intermediate qualifications.</p>
            <p>While MALC encompasses the broadest perspectives of service management skills, for example those related to project management and application design, it is not intended to teach these practices, rather to refer to them as contexts for ITIL application. A high-level understanding of these is still expected.</p>
            <p>This qualification focuses on strategizing, planning, using and measuring ITIL practices in an integrated functioning model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>How the service lifecycle stages form an integrated whole</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Process integration and interfaces</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Shared data / information / knowledge</p>
