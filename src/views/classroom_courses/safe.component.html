                    <p>Scaled Academy encourages taking the exam in one sitting, but you may take it over the course of several
                        days. i.e. You could exit the exam at any point and come back to it later or even the next day. When
                        you log back in, you will be taken to the beginning. You will need to click through till you reach
                        your first unanswered question.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>If you are completing the exam in one sitting, it could take up to 3 hours. So if you are starting the
                        exam on the last day, time it accordingly (start around 8pm or so) so you could complete it before
                        12am.
