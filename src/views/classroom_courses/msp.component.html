            <h2>Course Highlights</h2>
            <p>Managing Successful Programmes is a methodology that comprises a set of principles and processes for use when
                managing a programme. A programme is made up of a specific set of projects identified by an organisation
                that together will deliver some defined objective, or set of objectives, for the organisation. The objectives,
                or goals, of the programme are typically at a strategic level so that the organisation can achieve benefits
                and improvements in its business operation.</p>
            <p>MSP represents proven programme management best practice in the successful delivery of transformational change
                through the application of programme management. MSP is very flexible and designed to be adapted to meet
                the needs of local circumstances.</p>
            <p>The MSP framework is based on three core concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>MSP Principles</b>. These are derived from positive and negative lessons learned from programme experiences.
                        They are the common factors that underpin the success of any transformational change</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>MSP Governance Themes</b>. These define an organization's approach to programme management. They allow
                        an organization to put in place the right leadership, delivery team, organization structures and
                        controls, giving the best chance for success</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>MSP Transformational Flow</b>. This provides a route through the lifecycle of a programme from its
                        conception through to the delivery of the new capability, outcomes and benefits.</p>
                </li>
